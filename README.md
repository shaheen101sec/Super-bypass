# HTTP 401/403 Bypass Tool

An advanced tool to automate bypass techniques for HTTP 401 and 403 responses. This script leverages multiple methods to test for potential access to restricted resources.

## Features

- **Protocol Bypass:** Use HTTP versions 1.0 and 1.1 for bypass attempts.
- **HTTP Methods:** Test with various HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, etc.
- **Header Manipulation:** Send custom headers to bypass restrictions (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`).
- **User-Agent Spoofing:** Test bypasses using common and custom User-Agent strings.
- **Encoded Paths:** Attempt to bypass using encoded versions of paths.
- **Wayback Machine Lookup:** Check if the target URL is archived in the Wayback Machine for historical access points.

## Requirements

- **Bash** (Linux/Unix/MacOS shell environment)
- **Curl** for HTTP requests
- **jq** for parsing JSON (used for Wayback Machine integration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-bypass-tool.git
   cd http-bypass-tool
   ```

2. Ensure dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl jq -y
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x tool.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
bash tool.sh -u <url> -path <path> [options]
```

### Options

| Flag/Option         | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-u`, `--url`       | Target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).                     |
| `-path`, `--path`   | Path to attempt bypass (e.g., `/403/restricted`).             |
| `--protocol`        | Use HTTP protocol manipulation (`1.0` and `1.1`).            |
| `--headers`         | Use custom headers for bypass attempts.                      |
| `--method`          | Use various HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).              |
| `--ug`              | Use User-Agent spoofing techniques.                          |
| `--encode`          | Attempt bypass using encoded paths.                          |
| `--all`             | Apply all bypass techniques in a single run.                 |
| `-h`, `--help`      | Display the help message.                                     |

### Examples

1. Bypass using encoded paths:
   ```bash
   bash tool.sh -u https://example.com -path /restricted --encode
   ```

2. Bypass using HTTP methods:
   ```bash
   bash tool.sh -u https://example.com -path /admin --method
   ```

3. Use all available bypass techniques:
   ```bash
   bash tool.sh -u https://example.com -path /secure --all
   ```

4. Include Wayback Machine Lookup:
   During execution, the tool will ask if you want to check the URL in the Wayback Machine. Enter `y` to proceed or `n` to skip.

## Output

Results are saved to a file named `bypass_results.txt` in the current directory. Example output:
```
[HTTP 200] -> Method: GET, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0, Header: X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1, Path: /../restricted, Protocol: HTTP/1.1
[HTTP 403] -> Method: POST, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0, Header: , Path: /restricted, Protocol: HTTP/1.0
```
